        <p class="guitarparagraph"> At the age of 19 i started to get intrested at guitars.
            well, i always like it but i've never love it like at the age of 19.
            it is amazing what can do with just one instument and how relaxfull it could be,I think
            the best guitar player is Ed Sheeran and he's got a lot of good songs.
            so, my advice, just try to learn how to play on any instrument, it's life changing.

          <p>Like i said erlier i love programming.
            Solving problems is the best feeling in the all world.
            Sometimes people think that i'm crazy cause every time i learn 
            something new about programming (like when i learn how to build Ctor in c++)  
             they say i get super excited, i think to myself what else this langage can do and like you know
            there is always something new.
